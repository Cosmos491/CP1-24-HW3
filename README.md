# Homework Task

**Implement a classical electrodynamics function (e.g. calculating the resistance of a wire) as a python function and use this function as an argument in another function:**

use at least 2 of the following functions / concepts of functional programming (https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html):
- lambda function (https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html#small-functions-and-the-lambda-expression)
- map (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map)
- reduce (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce)
- filter (https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter)
- generator (https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html#generator-expressions-and-list-comprehensions)
- list comprehension (https://docs.python.org/3/howto/functional.html#generator-expressions-and-list-comprehensions)

---

For this you have to complete the following steps:

- Discuss in this repository using issus which function you want to implement. Everyone (but the maintainer) has to implement another function. Each homework task is a function that includes algorithm, docstrings (including module docstring with a description of the physics) and unit test.
- Each function should be its own module.
- Discuss who should be the maintainer for the repository. The maintainer does not have to implement a function but is reponsible for merge requests.
- Discuss and generate milestones for your function to optimize the timeline of your project
- Discuss and generate labels for your issues
- Fork this repository
- Generate the necessary files for your task and commit them. Commmit not just the final result but also intermediate steps. However every commit should have a significant change and a meaningful commit message. Otherwise you have to squash before merging is possible.
- create merge requests for your work

Also use discord for discussing solutions to any issues popping up.

## Tasks for algortihm, documentation, unit test

- pay attention to add references to all code you use from somewhere else
- each function should be its own (module) file (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)
- the unit test should use the assert statement (https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
