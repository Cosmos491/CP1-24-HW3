#Capacitive Reactance
Capacitive Reactance is a resistive phenomenon that occurs when an alternating
current is passed through a capacitor, or in certain cases wires that exhibit
capacitance.

###Parasitic Capacitance:
Parasitic capacitance occurs as a side-effect that arises between different
components of an electrical component, circuit, or system due to the specific
physical characteristics of a system. These characteristics may include geometric configuration of a circuit, proximity between components, and material
properties.

An interesting detail is that while regular (intentional) capacitance is
typically limited to capacitors, parasitic capacitance can arise nearly anywhere
in a circuit.

###Capacitive Reactance
X_c = [(2*pi)(f)(C)] where f is the frequency of the alternating current (in Hz)
and C is the capacitance (in Farads).

Single wires do not typically exhibit capacitance, however [...] and so in
certain high frequency applications parasitic capacitance can occur between
segments of a single wire as well as between a wire and circuit components or
other conductive components.

###How to Determine X_c:
-Start by estimating the parasitic capacitance C using knowledge of the system,
its geometry, and its surroundings.
-Determine the operating frequency *f*
-Use [Eqn 1] to compute X_c for the segment/component.
